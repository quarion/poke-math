Below is a summarized implementation plan for the Pokémon Adventure Game Progression System, tailored for handover to a smaller, less sophisticated LLM with access to your codebase. The plan is divided into checkpoints, each representing an independently implementable feature with specific details on data model changes, UI updates, formulas, and testing instructions. After each checkpoint, you’ll conduct manual human testing and provide feedback for adjustments.
Implementation Plan for Pokémon Adventure Game Progression System
Overview
This plan outlines a progression system for a Pokémon-themed adventure game, including Pokémon tiers, player XP/level mechanics, Pokémon appearance logic, catching mechanics, and UI feedback. Each checkpoint includes detailed instructions for data model extensions, UI changes, and formulas to ensure the smaller LLM can generate precise code edits.
Checkpoint 1: Pokémon Tier Assignment
Objective: Extend the Pokémon data model to include tiers for rarity and power.
Data Model Changes

    Pokémon Model Extension:
        Add a tier field (integer, 1–5) to the existing Pokémon data structure.
        Example structure:
        json

        {
          "id": "pikachu",
          "name": "Pikachu",
          "tier": 2
        }

        Update all existing Pokémon records in the database to include a tier value:
            Tier 1: Common Pokémon (e.g., Caterpie, Rattata)
            Tier 2: Slightly rare (e.g., Pikachu, Bulbasaur)
            Tier 3: Uncommon (e.g., Charmeleon, Haunter)
            Tier 4: Rare (e.g., Dragonair, Gyarados)
            Tier 5: Legendary (e.g., Mewtwo, Zapdos)

UI Changes

    None at this stage.

Formulas

    None at this stage.

Instructions for LLM

    Locate the Pokémon data model file (e.g., pokemon.js or models/Pokemon.py).
    Add the tier field to the schema/class.
    Update the database or data initialization logic to assign tier values to all Pokémon.

Testing

    Verify that every Pokémon in the database has a tier (1–5).
    Retrieve a few Pokémon programmatically to ensure the tier field is stored and accessible.

Checkpoint 2: Player Level and XP System
Objective: Add level and XP tracking for players with level-up mechanics.
Data Model Changes

    Player Model Extension:
        Add level (integer, default 1) and xp (integer, default 0) to the player data structure.
        Example:
        json

        {
          "id": "player1",
          "name": "Ash",
          "level": 1,
          "xp": 0
        }

Logic and Formulas

    XP Needed for Next Level:
        Formula:  
        \text{XP Needed} = 100 \times \left(1.2^{(L - 1)}\right)
        Where ( L ) is the current player level.
    Level-Up Logic:
        When xp ≥ XP Needed:
            Increment level by 1.
            Set xp to the surplus (xp - XP Needed).

UI Changes

    Add a display in the main game screen (e.g., PlayerProfile.js or game.html):
        Show "Level {L}: {XP}/{XP Needed} XP" (e.g., "Level 4: 250/400 XP").

Instructions for LLM

    Find the player model file (e.g., player.js or models/Player.py).
    Add level and xp fields to the schema/class.
    Create a function (e.g., calculateXPNeeded(level)) to compute XP needed using the formula.
    Add a function (e.g., updateLevelAndXP(player, xpGained)) to handle XP addition and level-ups.
    Update the UI file to display level and XP progress.

Testing

    Simulate XP gains (e.g., add 150 XP at Level 1) and check if level increments correctly.
    Verify UI updates reflect the current level and XP accurately.

Checkpoint 3: Pokémon Appearance Algorithm
Objective: Implement logic to select Pokémon based on player level and adventure difficulty.
Data Model Changes

    None.

Logic and Formulas

    Unlocked Tiers by Player Level:
        Levels 1–10: Tier 1 only
        Levels 11–20: Tiers 1–2
        Levels 21–30: Tiers 1–3
        Levels 31–40: Tiers 1–4
        Levels 41–50: Tiers 1–5
    Adjusted Weight Formula:
        For each eligible Pokémon:  
        \text{Adjusted Weight} = W_T \times \left(1 + \frac{D - 1}{6} \times (T - 1)\right)
        Where:
            W_T
            : Base weight (Tier 1: 100, Tier 2: 50, Tier 3: 20, Tier 4: 10, Tier 5: 5)
            ( D ): Difficulty level (1–7, passed as an adventure parameter)
            ( T ): Pokémon tier
    Selection Logic:
        Filter Pokémon by unlocked tiers.
        Calculate adjusted weights for each.
        Randomly select 1–3 Pokémon using the weights (higher weights = higher chance).

UI Changes

    None at this stage.

Instructions for LLM

    Locate the adventure or encounter logic file (e.g., adventure.js or game_logic.py).
    Add a function (e.g., getEligibleTiers(playerLevel)) to determine unlocked tiers.
    Add a function (e.g., calculateAdjustedWeight(tier, difficulty)) for the weight formula.
    Implement a selection function (e.g., selectPokemon(playerLevel, difficulty)) to filter, weigh, and pick Pokémon.

Testing

    Simulate adventures at various levels (e.g., Level 5, Level 15) and difficulties (e.g., D=1, D=7).
    Confirm only unlocked tiers appear and higher difficulties favor higher tiers.

Checkpoint 4: Catching Pokémon and Earning XP
Objective: Enable catching Pokémon and awarding XP with adventure completion bonuses.
Data Model Changes

    Player Model Extension:
        Add caughtPokemon field (array of Pokémon IDs) to track catches.
        Example:
        json

        {
          "id": "player1",
          "caughtPokemon": ["pikachu", "bulbasaur"]
        }

Logic and Formulas

    XP per Pokémon Caught:
        Tier 1: 50 XP
        Tier 2: 100 XP
        Tier 3: 200 XP
        Tier 4: 400 XP
        Tier 5: 800 XP
    Bonus XP for Adventure Completion:
        Formula:  
        \text{Bonus XP} = 50 \times D
        Where ( D ) is the difficulty level.
    Total XP:
        Formula:  
        \text{Total XP} = \sum_{\text{Pokémon caught}} \text{XP per Pokémon} + 50 \times D
    Catching Logic:
        Add caught Pokémon IDs to caughtPokemon (only if not already present).

UI Changes

    Update the adventure results screen (e.g., AdventureResults.js or results.html):
        List caught Pokémon with a "First Catch" badge if it’s their first time.
        Show "Total XP Gained: {Total XP}" and updated level/XP progress.

Instructions for LLM

    Extend the player model with caughtPokemon.
    Add a function (e.g., calculateXPReward(caughtPokemon, difficulty)) to compute total XP.
    Update the adventure logic to call updateLevelAndXP with the total XP.
    Modify the results UI to display caught Pokémon and XP details.

Testing

    Simulate catching Pokémon (e.g., Tier 2 and Tier 3 at D=3) and verify XP totals.
    Check UI for correct Pokémon listing and "First Catch" badges.

Checkpoint 5: UI Enhancements and Feedback
Objective: Improve UI with collection stats and tier unlock notifications.
Data Model Changes

    None.

UI Changes

    Collection Summary:
        Add to the player profile screen (e.g., PlayerProfile.js):
            Show "Tier {T}: {Caught}/{Total}" for each tier (e.g., "Tier 1: 5/10").
    Unlock Notifications:
        Display a message when a new tier unlocks (e.g., in game.js or notifications.html):
            "Level 11 reached! Tier 2 Pokémon are now available!"

Instructions for LLM

    Update the profile UI to calculate and display caught vs. total Pokémon per tier.
    Add logic in the level-up function to trigger unlock messages at levels 11, 21, 31, and 41.

Testing

    Catch Pokémon and verify the collection summary updates correctly.
    Level up to 11, 21, etc., and check for unlock messages.

Checkpoint 6: Final Testing and Balancing
Objective: Test the full system and adjust for balance.
Data Model Changes

    None.

Logic and Formulas

    Balance Adjustments (if needed based on testing):
        Tweak XP needed: Adjust the 1.2 multiplier in 
        100 \times 1.2^{(L - 1)}
        .
        Adjust XP granted: Modify tier rewards or bonus XP.
        Tune weights: Change 
        W_T
         or the weight formula multiplier.

UI Changes

    None.

Instructions for LLM

    Provide a list of adjustable constants (e.g., in config.js or settings.py):
        XP formula multiplier (1.2), tier XP rewards, base weights, etc.
    Update based on feedback after testing.

Testing

    Simulate progression from Level 1 to 50, catching Pokémon and completing adventures.
    Assess pacing (too fast/slow) and tier distribution (too common/rare).
    Provide feedback for balance tweaks.
