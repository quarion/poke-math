# Navigation re-work

## Functional description
Re-work and streamline the navigation

Main navigation:
1. Hide the "community exercises" page for now
2. Re-name "my quizzes" to "My Missions"
3. Re-name "New Exercise" to "New Mission"

Other:
4. On the home page change the "see all exercises" to "see my missions" and link it to "My Mission" page
5. Review all html pages to have consistent naming. Do not use "quizzes" or "exercises", but refer to what we have as "Pokemon Catch Missions" or "Missions" for short
