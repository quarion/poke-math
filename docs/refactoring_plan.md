# PokeMath Refactoring Implementation Plan

This document outlines future refactoring tasks for the PokeMath application. These are more substantial changes that require careful planning and execution.

## 1. Application Structure Reorganization

### Move ViewModels to Dedicated Module
- Create `src/app/view_models/` directory
- Move `QuizViewModel` and `QuizResultViewModel` from app.py to this module
- Add proper imports in app.py

### Implement Flask Blueprint Pattern
- Create blueprint modules for related routes
- Separate route definitions from app creation
- Group routes logically by feature area

### Reorganize Game Module
- Better separate responsibilities in game module
- Move game state management to dedicated class

## 2. Resolve Circular Dependencies

### Session Management Refactoring
- Move SessionManager to a separate module that doesn't depend directly on storage
- Refactor session state handling to avoid circular imports
- Improve session_factory implementation

### Improve Storage Module Design
- Refine storage interface for better separation of concerns
- Enhance error handling across storage implementations
- Standardize persistence mechanisms

## 3. Documentation and Tests

### Documentation Updates
- Update architecture documentation to match refactored structure
- Improve and standardize docstrings across the codebase
- Add inline comments for complex logic

### Testing Improvements
- Add unit tests for refactored components
- Implement integration tests for critical paths
- Create test fixtures for common test scenarios

## 4. Performance and Security Enhancements

### Security Review
- Audit session management for security best practices
- Review storage access patterns
- Implement proper error handling

### Performance Optimization
- Review and optimize database access patterns
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Review template rendering performance

This plan serves as a roadmap for future improvements to the PokeMath codebase.
