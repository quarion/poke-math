# MCP Playwright Workflow Notes

## Overview

This document outlines the findings and recommendations for using MCP (Multi-modal Conversational Platform) Playwright tools alongside Python Playwright for end-to-end testing of the Pokemath application.

## Key Findings

1. **Separate Implementations**:
   - MCP Playwright tools use Node.js/JavaScript implementation
   - Our e2e tests use Python Playwright implementation
   - Both use the same browser binaries but run as separate processes

2. **Session Sharing Limitations**:
   - Python and Node.js Playwright cannot directly share a live browser session
   - Each implementation launches its own browser instance
   - They maintain separate contexts, cookies, localStorage, etc.

3. **MCP Tool Constraints**:
   - MCP server only supports specific predefined commands
   - No way to execute arbitrary Python scripts through MCP
   - Limited to basic actions like navigate, click, fill, etc.
   - JavaScript evaluation is possible but limited to browser context

## Recommended Workflows

### For Automated Testing

1. **Use Python Playwright**:
   - Implement comprehensive e2e tests using Python Playwright
   - Follow Page Object Model pattern for maintainable tests
   - Generate reports and documentation with these tests

### For Interactive MCP Testing

1. **Manual Login Sequence**:
   - Accept that login steps need to be performed manually using individual MCP tool calls
   - Use the following sequence at the start of each MCP testing session:

```
1. mcp__playwright_navigate
   url: http://localhost:5000/login

2. mcp__playwright_click
   selector: button.firebaseui-idp-anonymous

3. mcp__playwright_fill
   selector: input#trainer-name
   value: TestTrainer

4. mcp__playwright_click
   selector: button.button-blue
```

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Custom MCP Tool**:
   - If possible, add a custom tool to the MCP server for session management
   - This would allow loading a saved state from a file created by Python scripts

2. **JavaScript State Setup**:
   - Use `playwright_evaluate` to set up some aspects of the session via JavaScript
   - Limited compared to a full login flow, but can manipulate current page's state

## Conclusion

While Python Playwright and MCP Playwright tools cannot directly share sessions, both can be used effectively in a testing workflow. Python scripts provide comprehensive automated testing with proper structure and assertions, while MCP tools offer interactive exploration capabilities directly in the conversation.

For now, we'll focus on building proper e2e tests with Python Playwright following best practices, and accept the manual login steps for MCP interactive testing.
