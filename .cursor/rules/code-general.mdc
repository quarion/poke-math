# Coding in any language

## Comments
- Create docstrings for modules, classes and selected library-like public functions and properties. For private functions include it only if function is complex.
- Include comments when the purpose of function or a parameter is not obvious from its name. For more complicated cases you can even include examples.
- For modules include information of the purpose (intention) of the module to help understand the application structure.
- In general keep comments focused on explaining "why" rather than "what" the code does.
- Do not leave comments about code you have removed or updated during the edit. Comment should explain current code, not how it was changed
- For non-docstrings comments:
    - Omit comments for self-explanatory code with descriptive function/variable names
    - Add comments for non-obvious logic, complex algorithms, or business rules
