# Coding in any language

## Comments
- Keep comments focused on explaining "why" rather than "what" the code does.
- Omit comments for self-explanatory code with descriptive function/variable names
- Comment non-obvious logic, complex algorithms, or business rules
- Retain docstrings for modules, classes and selected library-like public functions, but keep them concise
- Do not leave comments about code you have removed during the edit
