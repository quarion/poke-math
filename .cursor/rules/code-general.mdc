# Coding in any language

## Comments
- Omit comments for self-explanatory code with descriptive function/variable names
- Comment ONLY non-obvious logic, complex algorithms, or business rules
- Retain docstrings ONLY for modules, classes and selected library-like public functions, but keep them concise
- Keep comments focused on explaining "why" rather than "what" the code does.
- Do not leave comments about code you have removed or updated during the edit. Comment should explain current code, not how it was changed
