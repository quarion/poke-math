# Reference architecture
1. Check [architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md) for reference to make sure you are making changes in the right places

# Update architecture
1. If responsibilities of files or modules changes, update the [architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md)
2. If new python files or modules are introduced, update the [architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md)

# Coding style
1. Make sure code has high cohesion and low coupling through:
 - Favor composition (eg. through dependency injection) over inheritance
 - Favor pure functions over state mutation

Goal fo the above is to keep the code easy to reson about and easy to test
