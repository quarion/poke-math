# Creating implementation plan

- Reference [architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md) for current architecture overview
- Write the plan for yourself so you can follow it in next iteration
- Show the plan to the user for acceptance
- When plan is accepted output it to the original plan .md file below the requirements
- Summarize manual actions required (like server side configuration) in separate paragraph so user can carry it out for you
